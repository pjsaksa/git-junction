This is a rough guide for how to install git-junction. This is just a scetch for
now, and will be made more complete later on.

1. Setup two user accounts:
    1. named git and git-console
    2. create home-directories and bin-directory for each, and make sure each
       user's bin-directory is in that user's PATH
    3. configure and compile git-junction, which should produce two executables:
       junction-console and junction-shell
    4. copy junction-console to /home/git-console/bin/, and junction-shell to
       /home/git/bin/
    5. set junction-console to be git-console's shell, and junction-shell to be
       git's shell
    6. clear the password of both user accounts

2. Add the following lines to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
    Match User git-console
        PermitEmptyPasswords yes
        PermitOpen none
        PermitTunnel no
        PermitUserRC no
        PrintLastLog no
2.1. empty passwords should otherwise be disabled (as is the default) and public
     key authentication should be enabled (as is the default)

3. add the file '/etc/sudoers.d/git-console' with content:
    git-console ALL=(git) NOPASSWD: ALL

4. copy scripts/install-keys to /home/git/bin/

5. user git must have access to key storage kept by git-console
